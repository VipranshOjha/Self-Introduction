## About Me

Hi, I’m Vipransh Ojha, a third-year BTech Computer Science student specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at VIT Bhopal University.

I enjoy solving real-world problems, especially the small, everyday ones that most people tend to ignore. In the short term, my goal is simple, to find unique and interesting solutions to problems around me by building practical projects.

I am a hands-on learner and understand concepts best when I apply them. That is why I focus on learning through building. Many of the projects I work on come from curiosity and a desire to improve existing solutions, which constantly pushes me to explore and create.

Going forward, I aim to grow into a Software Engineer or AI Engineer, contributing to scalable and impactful systems. In the long term, I aspire to work on solutions that create measurable real-world value.

Outside academics, I enjoy teaching, problem-solving, and staying active through various sports, which help me remain disciplined and focused.

I’m always curious, always building, and always looking for better ways to solve problems.
